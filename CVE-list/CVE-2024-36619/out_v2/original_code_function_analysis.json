  "analysis_result": {
    "memset": "This function initializes a specified memory area with a particular byte value. It's mainly used to ensure no residues of prior data remain in arrays or structs being reused or for initializing new memory allocations.",
    "do_stereo": "This function adjusts the audio sample data in a structure for stereo channels, depending on whether the channels are correlated or not. It processes the structure data sequentially and either modifies or adds to certain arrays within the structure based on this correlation.",
    "av_log": "This function logs a message of a specified type and severity, usually for debugging or recording operational information. It accepts parameters defining the message\u2019s format and values and outputs it, typically to a console or a log file.",
    "get_bits1": "This function retrieves a single bit from a bitstream, advancing the read index by one. It considers different endiannesses and uses bitwise operations to isolate the required bit.",
    "get_srice": "This function decodes a Rice-coded signed integer from a bitstream. It first obtains the unsigned Rice code, then derives the signed value using conditional operations to determine the original integer.",
    "get_urice": "This function decodes a Rice-coded unsigned integer from a bitstream. It judiciously combines unary bit reading and fixed-length bit reading to piece together the complete Rice code.",
    "get_bits_left": "This function computes and returns the number of unread bits remaining in the bitstream. It\u2019s essential for boundary checks within bitstream processing functions to avoid over-reading."
