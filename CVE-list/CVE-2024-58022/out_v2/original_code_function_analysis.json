    "dev_err": "This function is used to log an error message for a particular device. It accepts a device structure, a format string, and additional arguments to format a comprehensive error message.",
    "resource_size": "This function computes the size of a specific memory resource by calculating the difference between its endpoints, effectively yielding the total number of addressable units within the resource.",
    "devm_ioremap": "This function takes a device structure alongside an offset and size to map a specified physical memory region into the device\u2019s accessible address space, facilitating direct memory access operations.",
    "platform_get_resource_byname": "This function iterates over a given device's resources to find and return the first occurrence of a resource that matches the specified type and name, or return a null pointer if no such resource is found."
