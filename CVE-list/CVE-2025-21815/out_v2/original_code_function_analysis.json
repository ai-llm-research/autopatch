    "count_compact_events": "Defines a placeholder for tracking certain types of events during compaction, without implementing any functionality.",
    "trace_mm_compaction_isolate_freepages": "A placeholder for tracking or logging events related to the isolation of free pages during memory compaction; actual implementation is not provided here.",
    "pfn_to_page": "Converts a numerical representation of a page frame number into the corresponding data structure that contains information about a specific page of memory.",
    "spin_unlock_irqrestore": "Releases a currently held lock and restores the processor's interrupt state to what it was prior to acquiring the lock, ensuring proper synchronization.",
    "compact_lock_irqsave": "Attempts to lock a synchronization primitive while saving the current state of interrupts, optionally tracking if the lock acquisition was contended in asynchronous scenarios.",
    "compact_unlock_should_abort": "Determines if a held lock should be released based on pending critical signals or the necessity to schedule other processes, indicating potential contention.",
    "list_add_tail": "Appends a new element to the end of a doubly-linked list, updating the pointers of surrounding elements to include this new element.",
    "set_page_private": "Assigns a specific private value or metadata to a given page's data structure, often used for bookkeeping or tracking purposes.",
    "__isolate_free_page": "Attempts to mark a specified free memory page as isolated for migration, considering memory thresholds and possibly splitting high-order pages.",
    "buddy_order": "Retrieves the order or size classification of a buddy system-managed free page, used to determine the block size of adjacent free pages.",
    "PageBuddy": "Checks if a specific memory page is classified as free and available for allocation according to the buddy system management scheme.",
    "compound_order": "Determines the size class or order of a compound memory page, used to manage large contiguous blocks of memory.",
    "PageCompound": "Checks if a memory page is part of a larger contiguous allocation such as a huge page or a compound structure, which are handled specially."
