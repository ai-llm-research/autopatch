    "folio_put": "This function decreases the resource counter associated with a memory entity, potentially triggering cleanup operations if it reaches zero.",
    "folio_unlock": "This function releases a lock held on a memory entity, and if there are entities waiting, it notifies one or more of them.",
    "page_folio": "This function converts a lower-level memory unit to its associated higher-level memory management structure.",
    "migrate_pfn_to_page": "This function maps a raw numerical identifier for a memory location to its corresponding structure used for memory management if valid."
