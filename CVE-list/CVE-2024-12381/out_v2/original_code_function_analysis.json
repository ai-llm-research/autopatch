    "EqualTypeIndex",

    "ValueType::has_index",
    "CanonicalTypeIndex::CanonicalTypeIndex",

  "analysis_result": {
    "EqualTypeIndex": "The function checks if two input indices are within designated index ranges and compares their relative positions or direct values based on where they fall. It ensures equivalence by considering both indices within the bounds of defined groups or by direct comparison if outside the groups.",
    "ValueType::kind": "This method retrieves and returns the categorical type or classification of a value type object, which helps in understanding the type or nature of the object.",
    "ValueType::has_index": "This method determines whether a ValueType object is associated with an index by returning a boolean status representing the existence of such an index.",
    "CanonicalTypeIndex::CanonicalTypeIndex": "This constructor sets up an instance of CanonicalTypeIndex, initializing it to store or represent a specific type index value.",
    "ValueType::ref_index": "The method returns an index reference associated with a ValueType, necessary for index-related operations or comparisons against other indices."
