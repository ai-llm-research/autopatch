    "group_priority_permit": "This function checks whether a requested priority level is permissible for an entity, based on certain predefined conditions. The function first verifies if the priority level is legitimate. If it is among the lower priority levels, it is automatically approved. For higher priority levels, it ensures permission is granted only if certain system attributes or master-level rights are present. If the requirements are not met, it denies the priority."
