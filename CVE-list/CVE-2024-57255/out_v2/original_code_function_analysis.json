    "malloc": "Allocate a block of memory of specified size and return a pointer to the start of this block. The memory is not initialized.",
    "free": "Release previously allocated memory, making it available for future allocations. It takes a pointer to the memory block to be deallocated.",

    "get_unaligned_le32": "Retrieve a 32-bit unsigned integer from a memory address, ensuring that it correctly interprets byte ordering and alignment."
