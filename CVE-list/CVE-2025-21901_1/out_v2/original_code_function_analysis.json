    "bnxt_qplib_rcfw_stop_irq": "The function stops the reception of Command Queue messages at a certain firmware communication interface. It checks if an interrupt is requested, and if so, masks the associated hardware interrupt, synchronizes interrupt handling, frees resources, and optionally kills the tasklet related to this interface.",
    "bnxt_qplib_nq_stop_irq": "The function halts the processing of notifications on a specific notification queue. It checks if interrupts are requested and, if so, disables the request, masks the hardware interrupt, synchronizes any pending interrupt handling, frees resources, and optionally terminates and disables the tasklet associated with this queue.",
    "auxiliary_get_drvdata": "This function retrieves driver-private data associated with a particular auxiliary device."
